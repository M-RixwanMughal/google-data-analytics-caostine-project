# Background
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

My Role: In this scenario I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal of designing marketing strategies for the company to grow their business revenue. 

Overall Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
Business Question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
